# Pharmaverse Examples
This repo contains end-to-end examples of using pharmaverse packages together to achieve common clinical reporting analyses.
The examples use consistent source SDTMs to create ADaMs (such as ADSL and ADAE) and using these as input to produce some familiar
Tables/Listings/Graphs and associated interactive displays (via Shiny).

Other examples will be added over time, e.g. for PK/PD or Therapeutic Area specifics (such as Oncology or Vaccines).

# Posit Cloud
Each example can be explored via a live and interactive Posit Cloud environment (preconfigured with all required package installations).
Please click the "Launch Posit Cloud" button to work with the live code.
Feel free to copy the repo and customize any examples for your own internal clinical reporting workflows!
