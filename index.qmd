title: "`pharmaverse` examples"
---

The true beauty of pharmaverse (and open source in general) is when efforts from
various different developers come together to compliment each other as a whole
greater than the sum of the individual parts. By design in R, no single package
will ever completely cover all your needs, but by piecing them together we can
make complex tasks increasingly simple.

This book contains end-to-end examples of using pharmaverse packages together to
achieve common clinical reporting analyses, such as ADaM and Tables/Listings/Graphs.
The examples use consistent source test SDTMs and ADaMs from `{pharmaversesdtm}`
and `{pharmaverseadam}` respectively.

We'll endeavour to include a selection of examples here over time, e.g. to help
users when trying out the packages for PK/PD or Therapeutic Area specific
(such as Oncology or Vaccines) analyses.

Note that this examples book should only be used to show how collections of
packages can be used in conjunction - more thorough examples of individual
package usages would always be covered in the package site vignettes and no
need to repeat here.

If you'd like to try out any of these examples in a live R session (via Posit
Cloud) or if you are interesting in contributing an article to this book, then
see more in our GitHub repo README.
