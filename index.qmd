title: "`pharmaverse` examples"
---

This book contains end-to-end examples of using pharmaverse packages together to
achieve common clinical reporting analyses.
The examples use consistent source SDTMs to create ADaMs (such as `ADSL` and `ADAE`)
and using these as input to produce some familiar Tables/Listings/Graphs and
associated interactive displays (via Shiny).

Other examples may be included here, e.g. for PK/PD or Therapeutic Area
specifics (such as Oncology or Vaccines).

Note that this examples book should only be used to show how collections of
packages can be used in conjunction - more thorough examples of individual
package usages would always be covered in the package site vignettes and no
need to repeat here.

If you'd like to try out any of these examples in a live R session (via Posit
Cloud) or if you are interesting in contributing an article to this book, then
see more in our GitHub repo README.
